# Meteor React Starter
A project to get you started build web applications with Meteor!

## What are we using?
* [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) - obviously :)
* [React](https://www.meteor.com/tutorials/react/creating-an-app) - This is Meteor's intro with React.
* [Kadira Flow Router + React Mounter](https://voice.kadira.io/getting-started-with-meteor-1-3-and-react-15e071e41cd1#.441xpasbc)
* [Semantic-UI](http://semantic-ui.com/) - Awesome customizable UI.  You can also write your own custom `.less` LESS files and put them anywhere that makes sense.  We are using `flemay:less-autoprefixer` with Semantic-UI so your custom LESS is automatically built and served.
* [okgrow:analytics](https://atmospherejs.com/okgrow/analytics) - This awesome package let's you specify your Google Analytics ID and that's it.  Everything that goes through accounts-base or Flow Router is tracked!.  And of course you can track custom events.
